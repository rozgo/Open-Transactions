Welcome to Open Transactions.

See LICENSE-AND-CREDITS file, which should be in the same
folder as this README file. You agree to the terms. 

Online install instructions:
https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki/Install

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

GETTING STARTED:


1) For most, assuming you have all the necessary libraries installed already, (OpenSSL 1.0.0, MsgPack, Protocol Buffers, and ZeroMQ) then
you just type this to build:
   
    make

   (It will auto-detect platform, etc.)

If you are building the Java version (for the Moneychanger GUI) then
use this instead:

    make clean && make java

2) To run the server, from this folder, type:
       cd transaction; ./transaction.exe

(It will give you instructions.)

3) To run the test client, from this folder, type:
       cd testwallet; ./testwallet.exe

(It will give you instructions.)

** PASSWORD ** is test (always)

DOWNLOAD OPEN TRANSACTIONS

git clone git://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions.git

Source code (FYI): 
https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions

----------------------------------------------------------------

BUILD THE TEST CLIENT

cd Open-Transactions && make clean && make


FOR JAVA MODE (If using Moneychanger Java GUI):

cd Open-Transactions && make clean && make java

---------------------------------------------------------------

BUILD THE API

To build the API for a specific language, try:

make java
make python
make php5
make perl5
make ruby
make c

Etc. Use "make clean" between builds.

See testwallet/API-README.txt for full instructions on building
the API for the various different languages. (There are more languages
available.)

---------------------------------------------------------------

DEVELOPER RESOURCES

The OT API, with notes:
https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki/API

Use cases for the OT API:
https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki/Use-Cases

---------------------------------------------------------------

TO START THE SERVER

cd transaction && ./transaction.exe

The server requires a password and a path when it starts up. 
(It will tell you what to do.)

FYI, the data folder for the server is: 
Open-Transactions/transaction/data_folder

If you want to back up a copy of it, then you can feel free
to play around with the data files, knowing you can refresh them 
at any time.

---------------------------------------------------------------

TO RUN THE TEST CLIENT

Once the server is running, then try the testwallet in a
separate terminal:

cd Open-Transactions && cd testwallet && ./testwallet.exe

Again, it will ask you to enter a password and a path. 
Don't worry, it gives clear instructions.

To use the testwallet, read docs/CLIENT-COMMANDS.txt
Online:
https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki/Test-Wallet-commands

Note: the test wallet and the API are really just different build 
options for the same client-side code, which is located in the 
Open-Transactions/testwallet folder.

The data folder for the client is: 
Open-Transactions/testwallet/data_folder
If you want to back up a copy of it, then you can feel free to play 
around with the data files, knowing you can refresh them at any time.
